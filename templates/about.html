        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

                <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
                    <p>
                    In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain
                    city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the
                    Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile,
                    he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated
                    in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
                    beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke,
                    and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet
                    "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

                    Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís.
                    They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. 
                    Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves
                    on the Quest of Erebor.

                    <p>
                    Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli.
                    He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
                    Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
                    Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.
                    Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim
                    the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                    the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies,
                    and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The
                    Company of Thorin.

                    <p>
                    Glóin son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who
                    set out to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father
                    of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.

                    Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in
                    The Fellowship of the Ring during the Fellowship's stay in Rivendell.

                    <p>
                    Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin.
                    He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on
                    the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.

                    A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one
                    of Thorin's closest friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him,
                    and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.

                    He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was
                    overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                    for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the Dragon Smaug.

                    Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives"
                    and "bending the forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described
                    as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the 
                    Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen companions.
